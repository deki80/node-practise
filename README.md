# node-practise

Practising Node.js. Create a REST app

No third party packages or express. Just Node JS

## HTTPS

Create a https folder in a root of a project, and generate a key.pem and a cert.pem files

## API endpoints

- GET /sample (testing purpose, returns a json object)
- GET /ping (returns a Status Code 200, nice for microservices, you can periodicly check if endpoint returns Status Code of 200 meaning app is alive and working)
